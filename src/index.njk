    <h1>Hi! My name is Yakov Danilichev.</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a human living on Earth, but with mind and big ambitions, 
      otherwise I get bored.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interests are mostly in computer science and maths.
      I do projects, which I want to do. You can find my work on 
      <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/omgthatsjackie" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

    <p>
      Aside from programming and all that stuff, I'm a host of my own Russian-language YouTube channel
      <a class="text-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwOxgW3Pv0zpsUkdfU5igKQ" target="_blank">Dan & Cubes</a>,
      where I express my passion for cinematography by making science videos about things that fascinate me.
      I love playing the piano, sometimes I compose music. I'm also keen on playing and watching football and basketball.
